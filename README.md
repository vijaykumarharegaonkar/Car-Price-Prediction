# Car-Price-Prediction

Through linear regression, we can predict values based on the corelation of variables. This can be very helpful in areas such as retail and e-commerce, where stores want to know the best selling price for their products.

In this project, we will use a vehicle dataset from cardekho, which is a company based in India that provides a car search platform that help customers to buy vehicles according to their needs. This dataset contains the following columns:
year
selling price
showroom price
fuel type
seller type
transmission
number of previous owners
The dataset for this problem is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho

We will create a model with the following steps:
Download and explore the dataset
Prepare the dataset for training
Create a linear regression model
Train the model to fit the data
Make predictions using the trained model
